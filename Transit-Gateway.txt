Transit-Gateway
Transit gateways are used to communicate among multiple VPCs, Instead of doing VPC Peering.
VPC peering is point to point to point , it will get complex for each connection.


1.Create VPC-01—10.0.0.0/16
      Create Subnet-10.0.1.0/24
      Create an internet gateway and attach toVPC01 
     Allow the communication to VPC in Route table -using internet gateway
     Allow all traffic in Security group
Create a VM in this VPC


2. Create VPC-02—172.16.0.0/16
  Create Subnet-172.16.1.0/24
 Create an internet gateway and attach toVPC02
 Allow the communication to VPC in Route table -using internet gateway
Allow all traffic in Security group
Create a VM in this VPC

Before creating transit gateway-Tty to ping servers-
NO COMMUNICATION.

  	 
Now Seclet transit gateway -Create
Transitgateway-01
Now Select-Transitgatewayattachements- Select VPC01-attach to transitgateway1
Add the route in Route-table
